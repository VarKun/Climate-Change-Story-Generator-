In a small coastal village, a young girl named Luna loved the ocean and all its creatures. But as the years passed, she noticed the coral reefs turning white and the sea turtles struggling to survive. Determined to help, Luna joined forces with her friends to reduce their carbon footprint, plant more seaweed, and protect the marine life. Together, they made a big difference, and the ocean began to flourish again. The sea turtles started to thrive, and Luna's community became a shining example of how people can come together to combat climate change and preserve the beauty of the natural world.
